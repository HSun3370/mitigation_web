2.1: Brownian Motion
--------------------

Under a baseline probability specification,
:math:`W \doteq \{ W_t : t \ge 0\}` is a multivariate standard Brownian
motion.

We partition the vector of Brownian motion into four subvectors as
follows:

.. math::


   dW_t = \begin{bmatrix} dW_t^k \cr dW_t^j \cr dW_t^y \cr dW_t^n \cr \end{bmatrix}

where the first component consists of the technology shocks, the second
component consists of the R&D shocks and the third component contains
the climate change shocks.
