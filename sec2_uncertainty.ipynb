    "We suppose there is a discrete set of jump states $\\mathcal{Z}$. Let $z$ denote a realized value in the set $\\mathcal{Z}$. Let $\\mathcal{J}$ denote a state-dependent jump intensity, and let $\\pi(\\tilde{z} \\mid x, z), z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$ give the jump distribution conditioned on a jump when $X_t=x$ in discrete state $Z_t=z$. Recall that the jump intensity, $\\mathcal{J}$, implies an approximate jump probability, $\\epsilon \\mathcal{J}$, over a small time increment, $\\epsilon$. Following a jump, $x$ changes as does the value function. For each choice of $\\tilde{z}$, $x$ jumps to the $\\tilde{x}(\\tilde{z})$, where $\\tilde{z}$ is uncertain prior to the jump. The baseline probabilities are $\\pi(\\tilde{z} \\mid x, z)$ for $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, where\n",
